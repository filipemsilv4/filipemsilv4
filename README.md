# Hello there! 👋

I'm Paulo Filipe, a Computer Science student at the Federal Institute of Northern Minas Gerais, Brazil. I'm deeply interested in the world of programming and enjoy the challenges it brings.

## A Little About Me

- 🐞 I've been on a quest to squash bugs since 2019. 
- 📚 I'm currently diving into competitive programming, which has been both challenging and rewarding.
- 🎯 Participating in the ICPC World Finals is a dream of mine, and I'm working hard to make it a reality.
- 🔄 I have a penchant for recursive acronyms. If there's something to be named, chances are I'll turn it into a recursive acronym.
